**Alignment and Summarized Experiment Creation** 

Load counts data from features_combined.txt

Check to see if it loads 

Load the metadata file (meta_data.txt) as the colData

Align the metadata with the counts

Create a summarizedexperiment-like object to save the data in

Filter the col_data to remove the disease status that is "tb_hiv_art"

Filter out the 0 counts across all samples

Create a new summarizedexperiment without the samples that we have filtered out 

** Create PCA Plot **

Convert to CPM and log-transform the pseudocount 

Transpose so samples are rows and genes are columns (PCA expects variables in columns)

Run PCA using prcomp (center & scale recommended)

** Create MDS (since we cannot run DESeq2) from PCA Distances **

Calculate distances between samples in PCA space (using first 10 PCs)

Run classical MDS

Plot MDS colored by disease

** Limma Analysis **

Load library and define variables

Filter to TB-HIV and HIV-only

Make group variable a factor with "hiv_only" as the reference

Check sample alignment

Manually calculate library sizes

Create logCPM matrix manually (as you already did)

Use limma on the logCPM matrix

** Create Heatmap **

Pull top 50 genes from your logCPM matrix

Get disease status for columns

Assign colors to groups and assign matrix of colors to plot as a color bar

Set layout to include annotation and color bar 

Plot heatmap
